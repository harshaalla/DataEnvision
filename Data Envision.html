<b> Introduction:</b> All around the world, there will be many disasters occurring every now and then. These disasters might be natural or manmade. Irrespective of the type of disaster, numerous people might lose their lives during these disasters and many more will get injured. Besides the deaths and injured, there will be loads of people who lose all their properties and become homeless. We want to visualize by generating some charts using the selected data related to number of deaths, number or people who got injured and number of people who lose their assets and become homeless. We also included the number of people who got affected with a particular disaster.
</p>
<br>

    <p>
       <b>Goal_01:</b> Our goal one is to generate a Customized Symbol Map to visualize the three different categories of disasters (natural, complex, and technological) across the world
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate this chart, we have used a free/open custom style in Tableau which was taken from www.mapbox.com. This website provides 14 other styles of maps.
        This particular map contains two different layers where the map is drawn on the bottom layer and on the top layer the pie chart is drawn on that particular location. The pie chart indicates three different categories of disasters (natural, complex and technological). In some locations only two slices are seen in the pie chart which means that the third type of disaster is not seen in that region.
    </p>
   <center> The default view of the chart is as below:</center>

     <center> The zoommed view of the chart into Asia and Africa continents is as below:</center>

<br>
<p>
    <b>Goal_02:</b> Our second goal is to To generate a Tree Map using three different attributes to visualize total number of injured people, total number of deaths and total number of affected people.
</p>
<p>
    To generate this Tree Map, three different attributes are considered (total people affected, total people died and total damage) occurred in particular location. The size of the partition indicates, the total number of deaths in a location are higher and lower the size of section indicates less number of deaths.

<p>
    <b> Goal_03:</b>Our third goal is to generate a Choropleth Map to visualize higher occurrences of disasters between years 1900-2016 in different countries.
</p>
<p>
    This Choropleth Map indicates the intensity of occurrences of all categories of disasters. Denser the color of the country, higher the rate of occurrences of disasters. Data for all the years between 1900 and 2016 has been considered to generate this map.

<p>
    <b>Goal_04:</b>Our fourth goal is to generate Packed Bubble Chart to visualize two different counts of deaths (PDE and UTSU) caused due to earth quakes (deaths types are described below in the screenshots section)
</p>

<p>
    To generate this chart, the count of deaths posted by PDE (Preliminary Determination of Epicenters) which indicates the deaths caused at the point on the earth's surface vertically above the focus of an earthquake and posted by UTSU (Dr. Tokuji Utsu, Professor Emeritus of Tokyo University,  who has been compiling "Catalog of Damaging Earthquakes‚Äù in the World) have been considered.
    The significance of this chart is that the size of the bubble indicates the UTSU deaths and the color density indicates PDE deaths, which indicates greater the size of the bubble higher the deaths posted by UTSU and denser the color of the bubble, higher the PDE deaths.

<br>
<p>
    <b>Goal_05:</b> Our fifth goal is to generate a line chart which shows the number of occurrences of natural disasters in each decade from 1900 to 2016
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This chart indicates number of disasters occurred in each particular decade starting from 1900 to 2016. This clearly shows that number of disasters occurred in the decade 2000-2009 are significantly higher when compared to any other decade
        </p>

<br>
<p>
    <b>Goal_06:</b> Our sixth goal is to generate a Stacked Column Chart which shows the total number of people affected and the total number of deaths caused due to various natural disasters in different countries.
</p>
<p> This chart contains different columns which indicates both the total number of people affected and also the deaths caused due to the disasters all over the world from the years 1900-2016

<br>
<p>
    <b>Conclusion: </b> With the help of this data visualization project, we have generated different charts and maps to visualize the number of deaths, occurrences, people affected, injured due to different kinds of disasters over the years 1900 to 2016 across the globe. With this we can conclude that the number of deaths caused across the world due to numerous kinds of disasters are too high and need to bring down using some kind of preventive measures.
